# Spot-Pulse for WearOS

Spot-Pulse is a Wear OS application designed to keep you informed about Nord Pool electricity spot prices directly from your watch. It provides real-time data, daily low/high prices, and a convenient Wear OS Tile for quick glanceability.

This project is a personal experiment in building useful applications purely with AI generated code.
